Another very rudimentary todo/checklist tutorials.
This is the last of the basic tutorials for todo/checklist. 
This like the ope checklist is really just the simple framework of it.

finished the project really like the very beginner aspect of it but it is very old so somethings are a bit outdated.
I need to investigate why the refresh isn't keeping local storage. I suspect it has to do with it being out of date
